# Too Many linked Lists

This is a project following [this tutorial](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).

Thanks to all the collaborators who made this. There are too many names to 
list but they are all listed on [github](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/too-many-lists).

The goal of this project is to comprehend:

- pointer types
- ownership, borrowing, inherited and interior mutability, and copying
- all keywords
- pattern matching, generics, and destructors
- testing
- basic unsafe practices

### First

I am starting by creating a new library named "too_many_lists" using the terminal command `cargo new --lib too_many_lists`.
